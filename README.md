# Computer Science from Scratch

This repository contains all of the source code for the book *[Computer Science from Scratch: Building Interpreters, Art, Emulators and ML in Python](https://nostarch.com/computer-science-from-scratch)* by [David Kopec](https://davekopec.com) and published by No Starch Press. The book, intended for intermediate to advanced Python programmers, features 7 projects of varying complexity from the realm of interpreters, emulators, computer art, and simple machine learning. In the table below is a description of the 7 projects and further down in this README there are directions for running (and testing) each of them. The projects are compatible with Python 3.12 and above.

| [Impressionist](#impressionist-chapter-4) | 4       | Computer Art                  | Impressionist uses a simple stochastic hill climbing algorithm to create abstract art from photographs that (sometimes) looks like the work of an impressionist painter. |
| [Chip8](#chip8-chapter-5)         | 5       | Emulators                     | An implementation of the CHIP-8 virtual machine that can play all of the 1970s games that were released for CHIP-8.                                                      |
| [NESEmulator](#nesemulator-chapter-6)   | 6       | Emulators                     | The simplest possible NES emulator with support for playing real games but lacking sound, performance, compatibility with most mappers, and several other features.      |
| [KNN](#knn-chapters-7--8)           | 7 & 8   | Super Simple Machine Learning | You draw a digit and the program can interpret your drawing (KNN classification) and/or complete it (KNN regression).                                                    |

## Running and Testing Each Project

The following directions assume you are in the root directory of the repository in a terminal and that your Python command is `python` (on some systems it is `python3`). The code is tested against Python 3.12 and 3.13. It will not work with earlier versions. 

**Please note that each project is run as a module from the main repository using the `-m` option.**

### Brainfuck (Chapter 1)

A simple [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter.

#### Requirements

No External Dependencies

#### Running

`python -m Brainfuck <your_file_name>`

For example:

`python -m Brainfuck Brainfuck/Examples/beer.bf`

#### Testing

`python -m tests.test_brainfuck`

### NanoBASIC (Chapter 2)

An interpreter for a very simple dialect of BASIC based on [Tiny BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC).

## Type Hints
The code in this repository uses the latest type hinting features in Python 3.12 and above. If you are using an older version of Python, you may be able to run the code by removing some of the type hints, but no support is offered for that endeavor. All the type hints in the source code were checked using [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).
